Use the slider to change the depth and angle of flat plate, observe how the pressure force change. The <span style="color: #18a558; font-weight: bold;">green arrow</span> represents the local pressure distribution and the <span style="color: #d61818; font-weight: bold;">red arrow</span> represents the pressure force \\(F_P\\).

💡 Notice how when the plate is not fully submerged, \\(y_{cp}\\) gets way deeper? This is becasue the equations used assume the whole object is fully submerged, so it kinda breaks when the object is only partially submerged.
